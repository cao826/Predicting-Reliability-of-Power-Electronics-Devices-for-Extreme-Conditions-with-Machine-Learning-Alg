# Encoder-decoder Version (Final title TBA)

This subdirectory contains the resources and scripts to run training and inference with encoder-decoder models. 

## Running the code

All that is needed to run the scripts is to provide a path to the data included in this project. 
TODO: Figure out how we want to distribute the data we have. 
To set the path, change line number 12:

```python
path = "/Users/....."
```
Replace ```path``` with the path in your machine, and the script will work.
